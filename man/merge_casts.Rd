\title{Merge multiple ASCII casts into one}
\usage{
merge_casts(...)

clear_screen()

pause(secs)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Ascii casts to merge or merge commands. Merge commands
provide a way to insert pause, clear the screen, etc., between casts.}

\item{secs}{Number of seconds to wait.}
}
\value{
An \code{asciicast} object.
}
\description{
The new cast will inherit its options (screen size, etc.) from the
first cast in the argument list. The options of the rest of the casts
are ignored.
}
\details{
\code{pause()} inserts a pause of the specified seconds between the casts.

\code{clear_screen()} clears the screen between two casts.
