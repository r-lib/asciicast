# asciicast (development version)

* New `cast()`, `capture_cast()` and `expect_snapshot_cast()` functions
  for lightweight cast creation and snapshotting (#61, #66, @krlmlr)

# asciicast 2.3.1

* New `show` argument in `write_svg()` to show the SVG on the screen.
  It is `TRUE` by default in RStudio.
  
* `play()` now show the output in the viewer pane in RStudio.

# asciicast 2.3.0

* `record()` has a new argument: `show_output`, to show the output from the
  subprocess in real time.

* New SVG theme: `readme`, to be used in `README.Rmd` (and similar) files on
  GitHub. It generates two SVG files, one for light and one for dark mode,
  and creates a `README.md` file that automatically uses the correct one
  when viewed on GitHub.

* New SVG theme: `github-dark`.

# asciicast 2.2.1

* New `expect_snapshot_r_process()` function to run a testthat snapshot
  test in an asciicast subprocess.

* On Windows asciicast does not error if the patch version of the current
  R version is different from the one asciiast was built with. This happens
  often when installing asciicast from binaries, and these R versions should
  be fully compatible.

# asciicast 2.2.0

* `write_html()` now supports ANSI hyperlinks.

* Much better parameterization of asciicast in knitr. You can now set
  asciicast parameters via chunk options. Relatedly, the
  `init_knitr_engine()` does not have an `options` argument any more.
  Set knitr chunk options instead. See the `README.Rmd` file of the package
  or the included `github-readme.Rmd` for examples.

* HTML output now works better in roxygen2/Rd.

* `init_knitr_engine()` has an `interactive` argument now, to allow
  non-interactive mode.

* asciicast in knitr now caches HTML output much better.

* asciicast now supports true color ANSI escapes in HTML output (#46).

* If the `asciicast_html_details` option is set, then asciicast puts the
  HTML output in a `<details>` tag.

* New `interactive` parameter of `init_knitr_engine()` allows recording in
  non-interactive R sessions. The default is (still) `interactive = TRUE`.

# asciicast 2.1.0

* The new `write_html()` function can create a themed HTML snapshot of an
  ascii cast. HTML otuput is now the default in pkgdown, for snapshots.
  For animations we still need to use SVG files.

* asciicast can now record casts on R installations that do not have an R
  shared or static library.

* SVG output now looks correct in Firefox with large fonts (#42).

# asciicast 2.0.0

* Completely new `record()` implementation that uses an embedded R
  interpreter in a subprocess. This means that asciicast can now record
  on Windows, and the recordings are of much faster and of higher quiality.

  Another benefit is that simulated typing does not happen in real time,
  but recordings are as fast as the script itself, and the simulated typing
  (if requested) is added after the recording.

  It is also possible to record R scripts that are not valid R code.
  (These will fail of course, but sometimes that's what you want to show.)

  `record()` does not set the `error` option in the asciicast subprocess
  any more, but the output of errors is simply recorded.

* New `record_output()` which returns the recorded output as a character
  vector instead of an asciic cast.

* Adding a `#'` to a line omits the simulated typing for that line and the
  line will appear in one step.

* New `write_gif()` function to save a cast as a GIF. It needs phantom.js
  currently.

* SVG output can have themes now. The package comes with a bunch of
  predefined themes, or you can create your own. See `default_theme()`.

* knitr options are set temporarily now, and they are restored after the
  knitr run.

* The `asciinema_player()` HTML widget now properly sets the height and
  width of the player window, using the `height` and `width` parameters
  of the cast.

* `record()` now works with script files that end with a comment line (#13).

* The initial R prompt is now not left out when recording a cast.

* `asciinema_player()` now creates an HTML widget that works well on
  Firefox as well.

* asciicast is properly tested now, so it should be much more stable.

# asciicast 1.0.0

First release on CRAN.
